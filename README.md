# Run-Length-Changed-Encoding-RLCE-
Run Length Changed Encoding (RLE, but RL isnt defined until it changes (or when item has similar formatting, making compatible with any type of item (hopefully xD)) thus reducing even more redundancy

All in all, the list count should be the same, this really only reduces item length as to not have its run length defined within every single element. I know ill be using this to compile string of data for my printer project! :3
